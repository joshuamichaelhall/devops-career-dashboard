# Career Roadmap Configuration Guide

The DevOps Career Dashboard now features a comprehensive career roadmap configuration system that allows you to customize your career progression tracking. This guide explains how to use the roadmap configuration feature.

## Accessing the Roadmap Configuration

1. From the Dashboard, navigate to the **Overview** tab
2. Look for the **Career Roadmap Progress** card
3. Click on the **Configure Roadmap** button in the top-right corner of the card

## Roadmap Configuration Options

The roadmap configuration is a 3-step process:

### Step 1: Select Roadmap Type

Choose from one of the predefined roadmap types or create a custom blended roadmap:

- **AWS/Cloud Specialist** - Focus on AWS cloud services and architecture
- **Kubernetes Specialist** - Focus on container orchestration and platform engineering
- **DevOps Engineer** - Balanced focus across the full DevOps toolchain
- **Site Reliability Engineer** - Focus on reliability, monitoring, and operations
- **Platform Engineer** - Focus on building developer platforms and platform engineering
- **DevSecOps Specialist** - Focus on security automation and DevSecOps practices
- **Custom Roadmap** - Create a blend of multiple specializations

### Step 2: Customize Roadmap Phases

For each phase in your selected roadmap:

- View the phase name, description, and estimated duration
- Adjust the current progress percentage using the slider
- Review the key milestones for each phase

For custom roadmaps, you can also:
- Set a custom roadmap title
- Choose which tracks to include in your custom blend
- Adjust the priority order of tracks (the first track will be the primary focus)

### Step 3: Review and Save

Review your configured roadmap before saving:

- View your complete career progression timeline
- See a summary of your roadmap phases
- Review the detailed breakdown of each phase with progress and milestones
- Save your configuration when you're satisfied

## Understanding Roadmap Phases

Each roadmap consists of four phases:

1. **Foundations** - Building foundational knowledge and skills
2. **Intermediate** - Developing specialized skills and practical experience
3. **Advanced** - Mastering advanced concepts and technologies
4. **Expert** - Leadership and innovation in your chosen specialization

## Custom Roadmap Blending

When creating a custom roadmap:

1. Select multiple tracks to include in your blend
2. The first track you select will be the primary focus
3. Use the "Make Primary" button to change the primary track
4. The custom roadmap will intelligently combine milestones from all selected tracks
5. Earlier phases will maintain more focus on the primary track
6. Later phases will include more specialized content from secondary tracks

## Tracking Progress

After saving your roadmap configuration:

- Your selected roadmap title will appear in the dashboard header
- The Overview tab will display your current progress in each phase
- Update your progress regularly using the roadmap configuration tool

## Recommendations

- Choose a roadmap that aligns with your career goals
- For early-career professionals, starting with the general DevOps Engineer roadmap is recommended
- As you progress, consider creating a custom roadmap to focus on your areas of specialization
- Update your roadmap configuration every 3-6 months as your career progresses
